# bpt11.github.io
---
bpt11.github.io is a test for using github pages, I'm considering using it instead of **neocities**. But, I might not, this is just a test.

If you'd like to view my neocities then it's located at https://bpt11.neocities.org

So far, I really like that I can publish changes quite easily just by opening github desktop and commiting saved changes. It's not super difficult to publish changes on Neocities, but it is just more quick and convenient on github pages, which is a pretty big plus.
