# bpt11.github.io

bpt11.github.io is a test for using github pages, I'm considering using it instead of **neocities**. But, I might not, this is just a test.

If you'd like to view my neocities then it's located at https://bpt11.neocities.org

So far, I really like that I can publish changes quite easily just by opening github desktop and commiting saved changes. It's not super difficult to publish changes on Neocities, but it is just more quick and convenient on github pages, which is a pretty big plus.

Update: Just spent some time and set it up so that I can just update my neocities directly through github with a workflow using the neocities api, so now it's just as easy for me to update it as it would be with github pages. So, I don't think I will be moving my neocities site to github pages. Maybe I'll use it still for something else eventually but for now I'm done.
